## Web Survey Tool for Healthcare Industry
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application developed as part of a final assignment. The goal is to collect participant data and analyze their income spending patterns in preparation for a new healthcare product launch.

Deployed app at: https://mynexfordsurvey.onrender.com/

🛠️ Features
✅ Web Development with Flask
- A simple and interactive web interface to collect user input.
- Collects basic details: Age, Gender, Total Income, and Expenses.

✅ Data Storage with MongoDB
- Stores user-submitted data in MongoDB Atlas.
- Expense categories are captured using checkboxes with text fields:
  * Utilities
  * Entertainment
  * School Fees
  * Shopping
  * Healthcare
    
✅ Data Processing with Python
- Implements a User class to encapsulate user data.
- Collected records are written to a CSV file for analysis.
- CSV is loaded and processed in a Jupyter Notebook for visualization.

✅ Data Visualization
- A bar chart showing ages with the highest income.
- A grouped chart showing gender distribution across spending categories.
- Visualizations are exported as image files for use in PowerPoint presentations.
